This software can be used freely for non-profit purposes. If you intend to use
the software, or any parts of the code in a commercial product, please contact
me. I am distributing the code freely to share ideas and because I think it is
a waste of time when people invent the same wheel. However, if you are 
profitting from long hours that I have spent in front of the terminal, please
share the proceeds.

You are welcome to modify the code, but please do not modify something and
pretend the changes are your own work. If you are making improvements to the
software, please contact me and maybe we can colloborate to provide better
software that everyone can use.
