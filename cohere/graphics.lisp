; PURPOSE: Lucid graphics for displaying networks (sg), line graphs (lg)
; and real-time activation graphs (ag).
; PROGRAMMER: Greg Nelson
; CREATED: 7-20-87
; UPDATED: 5-26-88
; UPDATED: 7-22-88 - made DEVOWEL a bit cleaner
; UPDATED: 9-6-88 - additions to function grapher (file labels, ELIMINATE)
; UPDATED: 9-7-88 - corrections to fg file reading functions
; UPDATED: 10-12-88 - fixed the spidergrapher for the new link format

; NEW PURPOSE: Macintosh Allegro graphics for networks and real-time activation
; for MacECHO
; PROGRAMMER (editor): David Gochfeld
; UPDATED: 6-4-90 - began to replace window initialization and drawing with
; Allegro code.
; Replaced *grapher-viewport* with *grapher-window* and
; *grapher-bitmap* with *grapher-grafport* (a "view")
; Macros and fuctions written for clear-bitmap, make-position,
; draw-line and stringblt.
; to 6-6-90
; 6-8-90 - Changed "grapher-window" to "actgraph-window" for
; use in End_ECHO_session in mac_interface.l.
; Began to excise code for circle activation graphs and
; for *acme-mode* from Activation Grapher section.
; Put in more constant for the Activation grapher, to replace
; Greg's magic numbers. See defvar section for activation-
; grapher, below.
; Set size of the view (*grapher-grafport*) to the same as the
; window (*actgraph-window*)
; 6-11-90 - Drawing FIXED: now draws activation graphs correctly into
; *grapher-grafport*.
; Use saving-window object class (from their example, modified
; slightly) to redraw grapher window after it's been covered.
; Don't need *grapher-grafport* -- draw directly into window.
; Now draws text onto bitmap as well as window, so the labels
; are also redrawn when the window is refreshed.
; 6-12-90 - Refresh macro to redraw window from contents of bitmap: used to 
; make labels appear in the bitmap font as soon as labels and axes drawn.
; This is a hack, instead of trying to set the bitmap font, which is a
; real mess.
; Added creation of Network graph window, and put actgraph window in
; upper right corner for default.
; Deleted sections for line-grapher and function-grapher. (half the file).
; Changed draw-line to take a window argument -- draw in that window.
; Changed refresh-win to select the window before redrawing it, so it
; doesn't draw its contents over a window in front of it and emss things up.
; 6-13-90 - Network Grapher draws correctly: 
; created function draw-circle which calls the Quickdraw oval commands.
; removed some fluff greg had that is no longer needed (particularly
; *second-label* and child-function stuff, and reduced childcnt calculations
; to one place -- draw-around.
; Changed name of kidsfunc to linked-units.
; Made calculations of x-radius and y-radius work in pixels.
; Replaced calls to font-fixed-width with calls to the toolbox routine
; _StringWidth. PROBLEM: may need to be done IN the correct window?
; 6-14-90 - Added mouse control to network grapher:
; *unit-loc-alist* contains the top, bottom, right, and left values at which 
; each unit is located, associated with that unit.
; window-click-event-handler
; record-loc converts loc of unit to a rectangle containing unit, and stores
; the rectangle and unit in the alist.
; search-loc looks in alist for unit corresponding to point.
; loc-test is the test used by search-loc to search the alist.
; Links are now drawn in patterns depending on weight: positive is black,
; negative is light grey, and zero is grey.
; 6-15-90 - reset-act now sets *actwin-x*, *actwin-y*, and *graphs-per-line* 
; depending on the current size of the window -- so if the window is
; resized before a run, graphs will be printed in it according to its
; new size. Resizing during a run doesn't affect the distribution
; of the graphs. 
; 6-18-90 - reset-act now tells you to enter a new list of units to graph OR to
; resize the window if won't fit in the window. Also, show-act
; now checks to make sure the window is open before drawing.
; NOTE: when a window is shrunk, everything off the edge of the window will be lost. So
; users should be warned not to shrink the activation grapher window until done with
; the information printed in it.
; 4-29-98 - port to MCL 4.2 and incorporation with COHERE
