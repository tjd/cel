;GOAL Calls "proposition" to set up a node and puts a property 
; to that atom that it is a goal.
; This will cause the running functions to not allow the value to go below 0.

; FACILITATE establishes the coherence links between units that facilitate
; other units. The optional argument VALUE allows a goal or set of goals
; to facilitate another goal with varied strength. SUBGOALS may be either

; are needed to facilitate a goal, the strength of their links are 
; weakened by an amount regulated by *simpl-impact*.
