; COH-SCORE-DUP calculates the coherence scores
; of a set of units partitioned into accepted and
; rejected. It returns a list of two scores
; %weight - the fraction of the total weight satisfied
; %constraints - the fraction of total constraints satisfied
; Input is a triple (number accepted rejected)
; This is just like coh-score except that it does not try to avoid
; counting constraints twice, and it produces a raw sum of constraints
; satified rather than a ratio.

(defun coh-score-dup (solution) 
(setq *all-constraints* (list-constraints-dup *all-units*)) ; note dup
(let ((num-satisfied 0)
(weights-satisfied 0)
(num-constraints (length *all-constraints*))
(constraint-weight 0)
)
(dolist (constraint *all-constraints*)
(setq constraint-weight 
(cons-satisfied constraint (second solution) (third solution))
)
(if (> constraint-weight 0)
; if constraint is satisfied by the accepted/rejected partition, then
(and (setq num-satisfied (1+ num-satisfied))
(setq weights-satisfied (+ constraint-weight weights-satisfied))
)
)
) 
weights-satisfied
)
)

; LIST-CONSTRAINTS-DUP generates a list of all constraints using the links associated
; with each unit (element) in a list. Each constraint has the structure 
; (unit1 unit2 weight). It is just like list-constraints in cohere.lisp, 
; except that it does [not?] avoid counting constraint twice.

(defun list-constraints-dup (list-of-units)
(do ((units list-of-units (cdr units))
(constraints nil)
(unit nil)
(units-done nil)

((null units) constraints) ; result
; repeat:
(dolist (link (links-from (car units)))
(setq unit (car link))
;(unless (member unit units-done) ; unless clause deleted
(push (cons (car units) link) constraints)
)
(push (car units) units-done)
)
)

; COH-SCORE-SUBSET calculates the coherence of a subset of elements, relative
; to a partition into accepted and rejected. Like coh-score-dup, it 
; can count constraints twice, e.g. when both e1 and e2 are in the subset
; and there is an positive constraint between them and both are accepted.
; Unlike coh-score which returns ratios, it returns a raw score of constraints 
; satisfied.

(defun coh-score-subset (elements solution) 
(let ((num-satisfied 0)
(weights-satisfied 0)
(num-constraints (length *all-constraints*))
(constraint-weight 0)

(setq constraint-weight 
(cons-satisfied constraint (second solution) (third solution))
)

(and (setq num-satisfied (1+ num-satisfied))
(setq weights-satisfied (+ constraint-weight weights-satisfied))
)

;================GOODNESS===================
; This is originally from run.l in old ACME.

; GOODNESS is a measure of how well constraints are satisfied..
; Returns 1 if no units. Need to divide by 2 since all
; links get counted twice.

(defun goodness (list-of-units)
(do ((units list-of-units (cdr units))
(value 0)

;exit:
((null units) (if (null list-of-units) 1 (/ value 2)))
;repeat:
(setq value 
(+ value 
(how-good-unit (car units) (get (car units) 'links-from))
)
)
)
)

; MEAN-GOODNESS cancels the effect of large networks

(defun mean-goodness (units) (/ (goodness units) (length units)))
; ****************************************************
; HOW-GOOD-UNIT calculates the goodness of a particular unit
; with respect to its associates. List-pairs is now a 
; list of dotted pairs (unit . weight).

; with high weights between them is high.
