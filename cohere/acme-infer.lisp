; PURPOSE: analogical transfer of propositions
; PROGRAMMER: Paul Thagard, adapting Eric Melz's work on Copying with Substitution and Generation
; CREATED: 5/14/98
; UPDATE: 12/1/98. broad-infer fixed to handle emotional analogies.

 

; Analogical inference involves transfer of information from a source to a 
; target. This can be broad or specific:
; 1. Broad: What does the source tell you about the target?
; - do full CWSG as in Melz, but make transfer more focused
; on the source and target, not on *all-propositions*.
; 2. More specific: What does the source tell you about particular
; aspects of the target, e.g. predicates and/or objects.
; BROAD-INFER expands the target as fully as possible using all 
; source propositions not already mapped to a target proposition.
; SPEC-INFER adds to the target only one proposition.
; The result of both kinds of inference is that a proposition in
; the target is positively linked to the proposition that
; was used to generate it. Analogical inference can be both novel
; and routine. Novel: a new proposition is constructed in the target.
; Routine: an already existing proposition in the target is linked
; to its analog in the source. 
; For system mappings, where the propositions are related as part of
; the same causal structure, the links should be much stronger
; than ordinary similarities. 
; Forging new activation links should automatically enable transfer
; of valences too, modeling emotional analogies. Inference with
; multiple analogies will also be automatically be modeled, since
; propositions from different source analogs can all be linked to
; a single proposition in the target.

; New variables

; SPEC-INFER makes possible inference of a single proposition in the target
; supported by its analog in the source. If the proposition to be inferred already
; exists, then all SPEC-INFER does is link it to its analog. Otherwise, it uses
; CWSG to produce a new proposition and link it to its analog.
; Here propn-to-infer is a pair of (propn-from-source propn-from-target)
